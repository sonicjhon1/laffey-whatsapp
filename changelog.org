** 3.0.0 [2020-09-03 Thu]
The =v3= release is here! It took around 3 months to get here, and a ton of work.

There are no deprecated features and there is a new one to adjust syntax color
tones. For full list, look for /added/ sections the previous releases.

Overall, I'm quite happy with how everything turned out ‚Äî especially the
=whatsapp.sh= tool. Huge thanks to everyone who contributed, and to [[https://github.com/E-RELevant/][Erel]] for
helping out a ton behind the scenes.

Erel also made a [[https://github.com/E-RELevant/WhatsApp-Web-Skeleton][WA Skeleton]] theme that can be used as a "screenshot mode" of
sorts ‚Äî which will hide all sensitive information ‚Äî and you can use it to
showcase your DWA theme in [[https://github.com/vednoc/dark-whatsapp/issues/178][this issue]] to show everyone how you use it.

Finally, I wrote a blog post that highlights this update. You can [[https://vednoc.me/blog/next-gen-of-dark-whatsapp][read it here]].

*** Build

- Updated colors for prev/next item in media viewer

** 3.0.0-rc.7 [2020-08-27 Thu]
Not many changes in this release; just updating styles to WhatsApp `v2.2035.12`
update, and adding an announcement for my new project --- [[https://userstyles.world/][UserStyles.World]] ---
that I've launched a few days ago as an alternative to =userstyles.org=, which has
been quite unusable for many months now.

If you'd like to contribute to development of USW, do check out the GitHub
[[https://github.com/vednoc/userstyles.world][project repository]]. If you're a userstyle creator, there's a section on
[[https://github.com/openstyles/stylus/wiki/UserCSS-authors][OpenStyles/Stylus Wiki]] in regards to writing UserCSS userstyles that will allow
you to host them on GitHub/GitLab or elsewhere. The process is pretty easy and
well documented, but I'll be adding something simpler to USW at some point.

There is just a handful of userstyles added at the moment since I'm a one-man
team (at the time of writing), and other priorities on the list take a lot of my
time to research and implement. Here's a short [[https://github.com/vednoc/userstyles.world/issues/1][Roadmap]] to keep track of ideas.

** 2.9.0 [2020-06-05 Fri]
Rewriting everything so that we can utilize WhatsApp's native CSS variables. All
of this is thanks to the ~2.2023.2~ update that broke /a lot/ of things.

*** Added
We are releasing a preview of our procedural color generation for background,
foreground, and accent colors in this update. Two months ago, we published
initial work for it in [[https://github.com/vednoc/dark-whatsapp/pull/145][#145]]; today, we're releasing it to everyone.

This is something we've been working towards for quite a while now, making over
a dozen of different implementations to find the right one. Since there are 6
tones for all base colors, the interop with [[https://github.com/vednoc/dark-switcher/][Dark-Switcher]] is no longer possible
until this functionality is implemented there.

What you see is still early-days, since we have to polish color generator rules
and include edge-cases, as well as see how it does /in the wild/. If you run into
issues, or weird looking color generation, we would love to hear it! Don't
hesitate to open a new [[https://github.com/vednoc/dark-whatsapp/issues/new/choose][issue]] and tell us about it.

Quick preview of changing base background and accent colors:

[[https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/18245694/83881589-33ae5f80-a741-11ea-8db3-f5edb1b1597d.gif]]

*** Broken features
A lot of our previous work is now broken in the new update, and we'll have to
rewrite or fix majority of the features you can find on [[https://github.com/vednoc/dark-whatsapp/wiki/Configuration][Configuration]] page on
our project wiki. Only the following features made it into ~v2.9.0~ release:

- Custom background/foreground/accent colors
- All app background image options
- Custom intro image
- Custom UI font

We will slowly but surely bring old features back in the upcoming updates as we
make our way towards ~v3~ of Dark-WhatsApp.

*** Fixed
- Issues where the new update was reported ([[https://github.com/vednoc/dark-whatsapp/issues/158][#158]], [[https://github.com/vednoc/dark-whatsapp/issues/159][#159]])
- Unreadable 'update alert' text color ([[https://github.com/vednoc/dark-whatsapp/issues/155][#155]], [[https://github.com/vednoc/dark-whatsapp/issues/157][#157]])
